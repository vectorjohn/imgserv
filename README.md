Imgserv - A tiny image server
=============================

Simple drop in image server.  You put it in a folder and it serves images.

The main reason to use it would be that it generates thumbnails on the fly to save bandwidth and improve loading times.

It scans its directory for image files and folders, and serves them up in a JSON file, which the frontend makes into a slideshow / browser.  An image can have a thumbnail generated by requesting it with a "thumb" prefix to its url.

Thumbnails are kept in memory.  Memory use is capped and old thumbnails are expired.

Known Issues
------------
Standalone version does not serve its own HTML/CSS/JS.  That needs to be hosted by something like Nginx and some url's proxied.  An Nginx config file is included with to get started.
